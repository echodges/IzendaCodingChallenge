Developed web application to demonstrate abilities in JavaScript and RESTful services.

Resoureces: Contains a snapshot of the expected output as well as given prompt.

IzendaCodingChallenge_Program: Contains all files required to run project.

	The main components include:
	
		index.php
		
		mystyle.css
		
		EventHandler.js
		
Some added functionality is provided. Likewise, some added features did not have enough time to be developed but were put in the project to show
future functionality (e.g. committing to the server was not listed on the prompt but it was partially developed upon submission).
 
Application allows basic CRUD Operations on a local copy of data from the server.


	Design Choices:

		Radio Button CRUD Selectors: A dropdown menu would've been just as effective but I liked the idea of seeing which function was being used at what point. Likewise, some functions could've been condense (e.g. The "viewing a patient" function could just as easily be done in an editable format) 
		Grid Layout: I decided to try an unfamiliar CSS framework from w3. The two-pane layout seemed to be the best way to convey information side-by-side. Likewise, the design is supposed to be scalable to multiple resolutions.
		Red Delete/Reset Button(s): Seeing red ensures that you're conscious of what you're doing.
		Gender Textbox: Retrospectively, the gender box should've been 2-3 radio buttons or a dropdown. At the time, the textbox fit better with my parsing method.
		Overall, I'd want to add more things to this project including photo ids, age fields, and potentionally patients' relations to other patients. The json element proved to be quite powerful yet again.
