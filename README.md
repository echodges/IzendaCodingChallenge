Developed web application to demonstrate abilities in JavaScript and RESTful services.

Resoureces: Contains a snapshot of the expected output as well as given prompt.
IzendaCodingChallenge_Program: Contains all files required to run project.
	The main components include:
		index.php
		mystyle.css
		EventHandler.js
		
Some added functionality is provided. Likewise, some added features did not have enough time to be developed but were put in the project to show
future functionality (committing to the server was not listed on the prompt but it was partially developed upon submission).
